**Compassionate AI for Emotional Check-Ins — Built by a Senior, for Seniors.** 💛

---

## 👋 About the Project

Welcome to the AI-MH-talk-tool — a conversational support system designed to offer gentle, judgment-free emotional check-ins, especially for older adults facing loneliness, grief, anxiety, or simply needing someone to “talk to.”

Built by Carol Lamon — a 69-year-old cancer survivor, AI learner, and long-time remote mortgage underwriter — this tool is the first step toward a larger vision: using accessible, empathetic technology to improve mental wellness for seniors.

## 🎯 Why Seniors?

Seniors are often overlooked in the tech and mental health space — yet they are among the most vulnerable to emotional isolation. This project was inspired by real life: personal experience, real conversations, and the deep need for connection beyond traditional therapy or chatbots.

## 🛠️ What It Does

This Python-based AI tool provides:
- Simple, supportive emotional check-ins
- Friendly, nonjudgmental conversation prompts
- A lightweight interface for seniors new to tech
- (In Progress) Options for printable affirmations and visual art for emotional reflection

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Python
- Git & GitHub
- AI prompt engineering
- Natural language interaction (early-stage)
- Future plans: UI layer, possible integration with HuggingFace or OpenAI models

---

## 📸 Coming Soon: AI-Generated Visual Companions

Carol has created hundreds of original AI-rendered images reflecting themes like:
- Peace & resilience
- Joy & nostalgia
- Grief & healing  
A curated set will soon be added to accompany conversational check-ins or exist as standalone emotional art.
